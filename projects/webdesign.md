                    <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
                    <p>To make this website, I downloaded the Text Editor <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> to write the HTML file I would use to make the pages. There were other websites suggested by my lecturer but this was the one I chose to go with.</p>
                    <p>Here's a list of alterative programs that can be used:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://atom.io/">Github Atom</a>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p></p>
                    


                    <h2 id="creating-html-file">Creating and Coding an HTML file</h2>
                    <p>To start making the webpage, I started by creating a .txt file but renaming the end of it to create the file in the .html format. This can be done by right-clicking on a blank are in File Explorer and set View to Details. This allows you to see the entirety of the file including its fornat and allows you to change it. When trying to create links to your other webpages, use the &lt;a href="" &gt;&lt;/a&gt; command and insert your website name adding the "/filename.html" at the end of the link to direct it to the file.</p>
                    
                    <h6>Image here kusa</h6>

                    <p>After creating the file go into the text editor and open the file you created there.</p>

                    <h3 id="coding-html">-Coding with HTML</h3>
                    <p>When I was coding for my website, I found <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3schools.com</a> very useful in guiding me through the coding process of website creation, teaching me the fundamentals and explaining how to use each command to produce text, bolded text, inserting images, website links and much more. After mastering the basics, the site also provides more advanced commands to add complexity to your website's formation. It also has guides for programming with CSS to stylise my site.</p>



                    <h2 id="creating-css-file">Creating and Coding a CSS file</h2>
                    <p>In a similar way to making the .html file, rename a .txt file to a .css file. This file is used to create style on the website by adding features like background color, arranging items within your website among other things. When trying to implement a style file into .html code, a link needs to be established via the link command.</p>
                    
                    <p> &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css /&gt; </p>
                    
                    <p>This creates a link to the .css file you created and also tells the website how to read the given code and where to find it. When organising files for my website, I like to sort my web files using folders. However when I tried to access the .css file outside of the folder, the program couldn't locate the .css file and the website was not styled. I later found out from <a href="https://digicompdiy.wordpress.com/2013/09/26/how-do-i-link-a-css-file-in-a-different-folder/">this website</a> where they gave the solution I was looking for. To acess the file outside the folder, use the directory ../ which will direct the compiler to look outside of the folder for the .css file.</p>


                    <h2 id="uploading-github">Uploading your files to Github</h2>
                    <p>Once I was done creating my folders, it was time to upload my code to the website. After creating my Github website, I went to the "create new respository" to create by website domain. When creating a respository, use an appropriate name for the website and initialise the respository by adding a README file and choosing a license for the website. After making the respository, it was time to add in the file into the code segment. Forr my website I decided to change the file format to .md on the browswer because I liked the look better that the .html format displayed.</p>
                    <p>And with that my website was set up.</p>
